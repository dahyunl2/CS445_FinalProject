# CS445_FinalProject

# Motivation and Impact
We chose this topic because AR filters are widely used in modern photo and video applications, and we wanted to understand how these visual effects are implemented using computational photography techniques. Throughout this project, we aim to learn how to detect facial features, apply geometric warping, and blend images realistically. Our goal is to build a lightweight but visually engaging animation pipeline that demonstrates seamless overlay of graphical elements on dynamic faces.

# How to execute our project

1. Open one ipynb file in Google Colab
2. Upload all of these filter png files (catEars.png, coolemoji.png, googly.png, mustache.png, sunglasses.png) into the root folder of Google Colab (path would be '/content/~.png')
3. Open any webcam application and record yourself.
4. Upload that video to the root folder of Google Colab and name it to input.mp4 (path would be '/content/input.mp4')
5. Run the cells in ipnyb top to bottom and get output video generated.
6. Tada! You can see a filter attached on and following your face!
7. Do the same things for each of four inynb files.
